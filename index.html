            Dairy milks are derived from the mammary glands of mammals,
            typically cows, goats, and sheep. They are also commonly referred to
            as "animal milks" because they come from animals.

            Non-dairy milks, also known as plant-based milks, are milk
            alternatives made from plant sources rather than animal milk. They
            are suitable for people who are lactose intolerant, have dairy
            allergies, follow a vegan diet, or simply prefer plant-based
            options.
